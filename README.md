# Node.js Tutorial

A beginner project with the objective of learning the basics of Node.js. I used the course provided by [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jsz4LDYc6kv3ymONOKxwBU) however I do plan on changing the project quite a bit after I learn enough, I will of course detail the changes here.

## Side Notes

I installed `lodash` while following the course, but I doubt I will use it in the future. I should use it to learn how to remove unrequired dependencies.
